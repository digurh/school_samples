7 (2x0)  8 (2x1)

Manhattan: however many total +1/-1 need to be made to the current [i][j] move
the number to the number into the correct [i][j] is the Manhattan distance


i * N + j + 1 = correctNumber

0 * 3 + 0 + 1 = 1
0 * 3 + 1 + 1 = 2
0 * 3 + 2 + 1 = 3
1 * 3 + 0 + 1 = 4
1 * 3 + 1 + 1 = 5
1 * 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
2 * 3 + 0 + 1 = 7
2 * 3 + 1 + 1 = 8

given 7:
