DeclarationList.[ch]

DeclarationList is an extensible list of declarations for one scope, block, struct or function.
You can pass a null (i.e. zero) pointer to add_decl() to add the first Declaration and use that
same pointer to add successive Declarations to the same DeclarationList.

The lookup_decl() function returns a pointer to a Declaration whose name matches the identifier
in the second argument.

The destroy_decl_list() deallocates the memory allocated for the contained Declaration instances.
