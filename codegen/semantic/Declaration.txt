Declaration.[ch]

The Declaration struct holds information for any kind of declaration we need:  variable,
formal_parameter, struct, member of struct, function and scope.  The information required for
each kind of declaration is different and is contained in each of the different structs
specialized for each kind of declaration.

The Declaration has a tag that answers the initial semantic question:  Given an identfier, what
is it?  The DeclTag provides that answer and from there, you can decide which member of the union
in the Declaration you need to access.

The different kinds of declaration can be extended as needed independently of the other kind of
declaration.  Putting the different kind of declaration a union allows me to make extensible
arrays of Declarations (See DeclarationList.[ch]).
