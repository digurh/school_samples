TypeInfo.[ch] holds information on builtin types and structs.  It also allows you to apply and
remove array and pointer modifiers.  The addition of modifiers extends the current TypeInfo
instance, but the removal of modifiers creates a new TypeInfo instance with one less modifier.
The creation of a new TypeInfo with a reduced modifier set comes in handy when parsing
expressions involving subscripts and pointer dereferencing.
